== Type inference

[quote, Java documentation]
____
The compiler's ability to look at each method invocation and corresponding
declaration to determine the type argument (or arguments) that make the
invocation applicable.
____


=== Type inference

[%step]
* No explicit type...
* ...but no ambiguity.
* = type safe!


== Java has no type inference...

[%step]
* Wrong!

=== Java has SOME type inference!

[source,java]
----
Subject<String> subject = PublishSubject.create(); <1>
//                                       ^^
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(); <2>
//                               ^^
Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c"); <3>
//            ^^
----
<1> Inference from context
<2> Inference from context (Java 7)
<3> Inference from arguments


== Kotlin type inference engine

Demo time!


=== Type inference is a sugar tool

All it does is preventing cumbersome explicit typing.

[%step]
* Wrong!
* Because *reified types*.


== What are reified types?

They can only exist within inline methods.


=== What are inline methods?

Methods that will be _forcibly_ *inlined* at the call site.

[source,kotlin]
----
inline fun square(a: Int) = a * a

println(square(42)) <1>
println(42 * 42) <2>
----

(1) & (2) are strictly equivalent.


=== Inline functions with lambdas

It enables
[%step]
* Non local returns.
* List / Iterable / Sequence manipulation.
* Loads of cool stuff!


== What are reified types?

They prevent type erasure.

=== What is type erasure?

[source,java]
----
// What YOU see in JAVA
List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();

// What THE JVM sees in bytecode
List<Object> list = new ArrayList<Object>();
----

Type genericity DOES NOT EXIST in the JVM!!!

NOTE: Of course, Kotlin is also subject to type erasure.

== What are reified types?

[%step]
* They can only exist within inline methods.
* They allow to take action on a generic type...
* ...provided that this type is *known at compile time*.


=== Reified types

Demo time!


== Reified infered types

image::tada.jpg[background, size=cover]

The type argument can be infered!

[source,kotlin]
----
inline fun <reified T> getInstance(): T = ioc(T::class.java)
//           ┌────────────────────────────────┘
val network: Network = getInstance()
----

[%step]
* ...is a Dependency Injection (IoC) container
* ...makes heavy use of reified infered types
* ...is developped and maintains by yours, truly
* ...has just been released in version 4


=== Dependency Injection

Don't call us, we'll call you!

== Kodein

Demo time!


=== By the way...

Kodein is...

* ...compatible with Android
* ...compatible with Javascript
* ...widely used
* ...a better choice than Dagger 2 :)

...but that's not the point ;)

== Conclusion

[%step]
* Type inference allows *conciseness while keeping type safety*.
* Reified types allow to *pass a type as argument*.
* Reified type inference allows to *infer type arguments*.


== Thank you!
